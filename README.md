This program is an assignment for Web Page Development 1 (IDMX-225).
This is a webpage built throughout the semester. It shows some of my interests, including photos and discriptions of the photos and explinations of the ways in which I engage with my hobbies. All of this is within boxes that seperate them from each other and the rest of the page, creating a visual indicater of their importance to me and the project. This webpage also inclues a section explaining some research I did into the topic of CSS sprites. For fonts I tried to use ones that were visually interesting without being designed in a way that can make it difficult to parse due to the design being too stylized. 

this program uses a color scheme consisting of rgba(209, 157, 96, 1) or #D19D60, rgba(109, 134, 145, 1) or #6D8691, rgba(105, 178, 209, 1) or #69B2D1, rgba(124, 114, 103, 1) or #7C7267, rgba(65, 77, 82, 1) or #414D52, and rgba(51, 42, 32, 1) or #332A20.

At the top of my page, I have the logo that I made with my initials, though for some reason I couldn’t get rid of the white bar at the bottom using the software we used in class. Along with this I have the name of the class and the navbar. Unfortunitly, I couldn't get the hamburger styling to work correctly. I tried following the videos given first and didn't get the results shown, so I tried looking for some other explination videos and still couldn't figure out where I had gone wrong.

I then have my introduction and bio sections. The introduction section as my avatar, name and where I live. The bio section goes more in depth about the things I want to do and that interest me, along with a photo of myself from high school.

The hobbies section has images that can represent some of my hobbies and interests as described in the bio section, styled to show the image alongside a text description of the photo.

In the blog section, formerly lit, I have written about the “background-image” property that I researched. I tried to explain how it is used and the specifics of setting it up in a website like this one. Along with this I have examples where I tried to show both, what this property looks like in action and what the back-end code looks like to get that result.

There is a short video showing what I did for the midterm. 

I also have a contact form for those that wish to get ahold of me or leave questions or concerns.
