                <p>Background-image property is the way a programmer sets images for backgrounds in an element. If an image or images are desired as a background the "background-image" property is used. Any backgroundimage will be aligned to the top-left corner of the element it is a part of, and the repeated vertically and horizontally by default.</p>

                <p>Applying the image requires that it be set up in the stylesheet, broken down by what part of the website you want the image to be under, with the most common being "body" as a means of placing the image either behind the text entirely or to put it behind the solid color element above it. This can also be used to just place photos as the background of a section such as the "hero" section.</p>

                <p>When building this in the stylesheet it is important that the stylesheet is in a CSS folder the the purpose of orginization, but because of its location you will need to add "../" at the start of the image to find the image under the image file. Often something like this looks like: "background-image: url(../Images/filler.jpeg);.</p>
            
                <p>It is best practice to always place a background color for the element so that if something would cause an issue with loading the image, the text would still be legible. An important part of this is finding a color for the text that allows it to contrast well with both the image and the color. This is important to help those with any type of color blindness, or to avoid the text being the same color as the background of the webpage. One way to help create easier contrast is to use “background-blend-mode” to mix the image with the background color behind it to change the look and feel of the image. This is another reason to have a background color set.</p>

                <p>To adjust the sizing of the section with the background image, it is helpful to use padding because it will center the text better than using height and width as the method of spacing. Typically, the padding with be top and bottom. While it is possible to control everything from the background image by using just “background-image” in a style sheet, it might be best to break it down into multiple sections so any potential issues are easier to troubleshoot and resolve.</p>

                <p>Stylistically, you can use the “background-repeat” property to choose if and how much it repeats, with patterns being better to repeat than most images. An important element of the styling of a photo is the sizing, and getting it to scale without repeating as you go up in screen size. Finding a balance of size can help prevent the image from repeating, or from being blurry as the size of the monitor scales up, as well as assisting with the optimization of the webpage as a whole. Larger images can cause issues with loading a page, and make scaling difficult. One way to do this is to use “background-size: cover;” to set the image to fit in the space, cropping the image to fit the section it is in, scaling as needed.</p>

                <p>Another aspect of aligning a background image is to use “background-position” to move the image within the bounds of the element it is a part of. To move the image within the element you would first need padding, and them can use either units such as “25px” and “50%”, or make use of keywords like “bottom” and “top”. You can also combine the units and keywords to adjust exactly where the background image will appear. You can use “padding” for helping adjust the size of the element, and “margin” to separate and differentiate the element from others. Two or more images can be controlled in the same <div> by using a second set of modifiers after each “background” by adding a comma after the first “background-image”, and adjusting it how you want by adding additional units and keywords after the initial ones and a comma. I have provided some examples below.</p>
