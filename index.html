            <h2>An excerpt from Bram Stoker's Dracula</h2>
            <div>
                <p>The morning of 16 May broke bright and cheerful. The sun shone warm and brilliant, and the birds sang sweetly in the trees. The very air seemed full of hope and happiness. I felt that the cloud of gloom which had been hanging over us for so long was lifting, and that we were about to enter upon a new phase of our strange and terrible experience.</p>

                <p>I am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me. It is destroying my nerve. I start at my own shadow, and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings. God knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place! I looked out over the beautiful expanse, bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day.</p>

                <p>How these papers have been placed in sequence will be made manifest in the reading of them. All needless matters have been eliminated, so that a history almost at variance with the possibilities of later-day belief may stand forth as simple fact. There is throughout no statement of past things wherein memory may err, for all the records chosen are exactly contemporary, given from the standpoints and within the range of knowledge of those who made them.</p>
